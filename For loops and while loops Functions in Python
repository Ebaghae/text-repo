1) While loop syntax: A while loop is a control structure that allows you to repeatedly execute a block of code for as long as a certain condition is true. 
syntax:
x = 1
while x < 100:
   print(x)
   x = x*2
result: 1, 2, 4, 8,16, 32, 64

2) For loop syntax: A for loop is a control structure that allows you to execute a block of code the same number of times as there are elements in an iterable sequence. 
Syntax:
num = 5
y = [1, 2, 3]
for num in y:
   print(num)

print(num)
result: 1, 2, 3, 3

3) range() function: The range() function is a function that takes three arguments: start, stop, step. Its output is an object belonging to the range class. 
If you only include one argument, it will be interpreted as the stop value. The start and step values by default will be zero and one, respectively. 
If you include two arguments, they will be interpreted as the start and stop values (again, with step being one by default).
Note that the stop value is not included in the range that is returned.
syntax:
for n in range(2, 5):
   print(n)
result: 2, 3, 4

syntax:
for even_num in range(2, 11, 2):
   print(even_num)
result: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
